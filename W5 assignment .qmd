## [**Problem 1: Anscombe (1973) Dataset:**]{.underline}

First, I opened up the dataset and explored the dataset.

```{r}
#| results: hide 
anscombe_quartet= readRDS("/Users/chenshin/Desktop/Longitudinal_Data_Analysis_Practical/week_5/week5/anscombe quartet.rds")

str(anscombe_quartet) 

result1 <- anscombe_quartet %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_x    = mean(x),
    mean_y    = mean(y),
    min_x     = min(x),
    min_y     = min(y),
    max_x     = max(x),
    max_y     = max(y),
    crrltn    = cor(x, y)
  ) 
```

str() tells us the type of function it is, ie character, number, etc.

```{r}
knitr::kable(result1, digits=2, caption="Table 1: Anscombe Quartet Descriptive Statistics") 
```

The summary statistics tell us that the mean of x and y are the same for all of the datasets. They also have the same strong correlation between x and y of r= 0.816. The summary table also tells us the range, which is calculated by subtracting the maximum values from the minimum values. The range for the y axis is similar for all four datasets, and the range for the x axis is similar for the first three datasets, while being much larger for dataset 4. This could indicate the presence of a potenital outlier, due to the similarities in the other summary statistics other than the x-maximum value.

Next, I plotted the datasets.

```{r}
 ggplot(anscombe_quartet, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",formula = "y ~ x") +
  facet_wrap(~dataset) 
```

The plots tell us that the four datasets are very different from each other, which was obscured by the summary statistics. The first dataset is pretty scattered although there does seem to be a trend upwards and following a slight linear pattern. Dataset two shows a more quadratic relationship. Dataset 3 generally follows a linear trend but this is skewed by a clear outlier. Finally, dataset four is a straight line of the datapoints, and there is one outlier. The true patterns could only be seen with plotting the datasets.

Linear regression would not be an appropriate statistical model to analyze the x-y relationship, because there is not a linear pattern for each one. It would only be appropriate for dataset 3.

The four datasets are extremely different. Trying to fit them into a linear model would not be appropriate, and running a correlation (all the same 0.81) does not show the proper relationships between x and y variables.

## [**Problem 2: Datasaurus Dataset:**]{.underline}

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen = readRDS("/Users/chenshin/Desktop/Longitudinal_Data_Analysis_Practical/week_5/week5/datasaurus_dozen.rds") 
```

First, I explored the different datasets in Datasaurus, and explored summary and descriptive statistics.

```{r}
#| results: hide 
result <- datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarise( mean_x = mean(x), 
             mean_y = mean(y), 
             min_x = min(x), 
             min_y = min(y), 
             max_x = max(x), 
             max_y = max(y), 
             crrltn = cor(x, y) ) 
```

There are 13 different shapes, and the mean of all xs for each shape and ys is the same. The range varies between the shapes. The correlation of x and y is -0.06 for each, which is close to 0, meaning there is no linear relationship.

This is depicted in a table below:

```{r}
knitr::kable(result, digits=2, caption="Table 2: Datasaurus Descriptive Statistics") 
```

The results are also plotted below:

```{r}
#| results: hide 
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x=x,y=y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm",formula = "y ~ x") + facet_wrap(~dataset) 
```
